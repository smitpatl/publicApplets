# Math Interactive Applets

This repository contains a collection of interactive math visualization applets designed to help students understand mathematical concepts through visual and interactive learning.

## Available Applets

- [Box Height](./Box%20Height/) - Find the height of a box given its volume, length, and width.
- [Box Dimensions](./Box%20Dimensions/) - Learn volume conservation by visualizing what happens when a box is melted into another cuboid whose width is 16 cm and length = height. The visualization shows a box with constant width progressively getting larger through volume steps: 400 cm続, 600 cm続, 800 cm続, and 1000 cm続.

## How to Use

1. Visit the [applets index page](./index.html) for a complete listing of available applets.
2. Click on any applet card to launch the interactive visualization.
3. You can also access these applets online at [https://smitpatl.github.io/publicApplets/](https://smitpatl.github.io/publicApplets/)

## Adding New Applets

To add a new applet to this collection:

1. Create a new folder with your applet name in this directory
2. Add an `index.html` file in that folder with your applet's content
3. Ensure any shared resources are properly referenced (e.g., `../js/zdog.dist.min.js`)
4. The applet will automatically appear in the GitHub Pages site

## GitHub Pages Setup

This repository is configured to be hosted on GitHub Pages. When changes are pushed to the main branch, the applets are automatically published and accessible online.
